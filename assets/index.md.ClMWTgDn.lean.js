My name is Denis Starov. I&#39;m the author and developer of Chromatone - the Visial Music Language. I&#39;m bringing Isaac Newton&#39;s ideas to modern technology levels: now we can establish consistent relations between frequencies of sound and light with microphones, synthesizers, sequencers, screens, LEDs etc.</p><p>Hundreds of students all around the world are already using my instrument stickers and interactive web-apps to study, practice and improve their music skills. But real face to face group education appears to be the core of human educational system. My 8+ years experience in music and multimedia production as well as personal music tutorship sessions show high educational potential of Chromatone system and my practical skills being shared with eager students. And group classes can become a gamechanger for many people - it&#39;s our primordial way of learning things and it may help overcome daily routine and find time to go study something interesting together with other people.</p>',7)),a(c),a(s(o)),a(h),e[1]||(e[1]=t('<h3 id="my-path-to-school" tabindex="-1">My path to school <a class="header-anchor" href="#my-path-to-school" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;My path to school&quot;">​</a></h3><p>While being phenomenally different, sensations converge in our minds and there we can build any kinds of connections. It&#39;s where we start seeing music. That&#39;s how I studied music myself: with colorful stickers applied on the keyboard of my OP-1 and a memo cheatsheet with diagrams of all chords in basic diatonic scales to put at sight and go with all this to any rehearsal or jam place to start exploring this space with other musicians.</p><p>And then I realized how valuable those unique moments of joy are when people play together in sync, and got immersed in live music more and more. While having published tracks and experience in many other fields, live jam performance is my main focus for many years and from many perspectives.</p><p>Around year 2017 it all started as web development excercise app just to calculate the frequency of note A 40th octave and compare it to light spectrum. After I saw red A and how octave fits with color circle, I never stopped developing this project further. It has grown into a web-site, a sticker shop, a video-course collaboration with SkillBox, a book in the making. Now Chromatone is quite a developed research with plenty of theory and practice materials ready to be shared with people around.</p><p>Online tutorship and courses are not that effective as we are so used to videos with no interaction with other students. It is a crucial part of real study. As a grownup you want effective education for student of any level of starting and achievable knowledge and skill. And I want to explore this field more by starting to grow a creative multimedia school with 4 programs to provide valuable knowledge and skills to both local and global communities of music explorers.</p><p>Dynamic group education is an important part of study process as it provides opportunities to also ask questions and explain something to others so that you better understand the subject yourself.</p><p>So, here&#39;s what we have now:</p><ul><li>1 month long courses</li><li>Weekly classes with creative homework</li><li>4-8 students per course</li></ul><h2 id="jam-sessions" tabindex="-1">Jam sessions <a class="header-anchor" href="#jam-sessions" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Jam sessions&quot;">​</a></h2><h3 id="biweekly-jam-workshops" tabindex="-1">Biweekly jam workshops <a class="header-anchor" href="#biweekly-jam-workshops" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Biweekly jam workshops&quot;">​</a></h3><ul><li>1 hour introduction</li><li>2 hour jam session</li><li>Formats interchange <ul><li>Acoustic</li><li>Electronic</li></ul></li></ul>',11))]))}});export{g as __pageData,v as default};
