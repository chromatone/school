My name is Denis Starov. I&#39;m the author and developer of Chromatone - the Visial Music Language. I found a point where ideas of Isaac Newton meet modern technology and science. Now we can establish consistent relations between notes and colors and bring higher awareness to music analysis, performance, composition and production. The same note across octaves, frets and bars will have the same color and there&#39;s much benefit from it!</p><p>Hundreds of students all around the world are already using our instrument stickers, printed memos and interactive web-apps to study, practice and improve their music skills. Real life face to face group study appears to be at the core of any human educational system. My 8+ years experience in self-guided music research and multimedia production as well as relative success of my first video-course on Visual Music Theory have shown high educational potential of Chromatone system. At some point I&#39;ve discovered 4 main perspectives from which we can look at music and multimedia art together.</p><p>Visual Music Theory helps understand at notes and scales, Collaborative Jam Performance is a way to enjoy implementing this knowledge with others, Live Multimedia Production focuses on recording and processing content while Creative Web-Development is about apps and their features.</p><p>I will share my experience, help you build your own knowledge and plan of action to develop sufficient skills to use it creatively. You are free to use all this for your self-expression!</p>',9)),a(h),a(s(t)),a(c),e[1]||(e[1]=o('<h3 id="visual-music-school" tabindex="-1">Visual Music School <a class="header-anchor" href="#visual-music-school" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Visual Music School&quot;">​</a></h3><p>While being phenomenally different, sensations converge in our minds and there we can build any kinds of connections. It&#39;s where we start seeing music. That&#39;s how I studied music myself: with colorful stickers applied on the keyboard of my OP-1 and a memo cheatsheet with diagrams of all chords in basic diatonic scales to put at sight and go with all this to any rehearsal or jam place to start exploring this space with other musicians.</p><p>And then I realized how valuable those unique moments of joy are when people play together in sync, and got immersed in live music more and more. While having published tracks and experience in many other fields, live jam performance is my main focus for many years and from many perspectives.</p><p>Around year 2017 it all started as web development excercise app just to calculate the frequency of note A 40th octave and compare it to light spectrum. After I saw red A and how octave fits with color circle, I never stopped developing this project further. It has grown into a web-site, a sticker shop, a video-course collaboration with SkillBox, a book in the making. Now Chromatone is quite a developed research with plenty of theory and practice materials ready to be shared with people around.</p><p>Online tutorship and courses are not that effective as we are so used to videos with no interaction with other students. It is a crucial part of real study. As a grownup you want effective education for student of any level of starting and achievable knowledge and skill. And I want to explore this field more by starting to grow a creative multimedia school with 4 programs to provide valuable knowledge and skills to both local and global communities of music explorers.</p><p>Dynamic group education is an important part of study process as it provides opportunities to also ask questions and explain something to others so that you better understand the subject yourself.</p><p>So, here&#39;s what we have now:</p><ul><li>1 month long courses</li><li>Weekly classes with creative homework</li><li>4-8 students per course</li></ul><h2 id="jam-sessions" tabindex="-1">Jam sessions <a class="header-anchor" href="#jam-sessions" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Jam sessions&quot;">​</a></h2><h3 id="biweekly-jam-workshops" tabindex="-1">Biweekly jam workshops <a class="header-anchor" href="#biweekly-jam-workshops" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Biweekly jam workshops&quot;">​</a></h3><ul><li>1 hour introduction</li><li>2 hour jam session</li><li>Formats interchange <ul><li>Acoustic</li><li>Electronic</li></ul></li></ul>',11))]))}});export{k as __pageData,x as default};
