My name is Denis Starov. I&#39;m the author and developer of Chromatone - the Visial Music Language. I found a point where ideas of Isaac Newton meet modern technology and science. Now we can establish consistent relations between notes and colors and bring visual awareness to music analysis, performance, composition and production. The same notes across octaves, frets and bars will have the same color and even rhythms!</p><p>Hundreds of students all around the world are already using my instrument stickers, printed memos and interactive web-apps to study, practice and improve their music skills. Real life face to face group study appears to be at the core of any human educational system. My 8+ years experience of self-guided music research and multimedia production as well as release of my first video-course on Visual Music Theory have shown high educational potential of Chromatone system. Dozens of students graduated with their own composed songs.</p><p>At some point I&#39;ve discovered 4 main perspectives from which we can look at music and multimedia art together.</p><p><strong>Visual Music Theory</strong> helps understanding rhythms, notes, intervals, chords and scales, <strong>Collaborative Jam Performance</strong> is a way to enjoy implementing this knowledge with others, <strong>Live Multimedia Production</strong> focuses on recording and processing content while <strong>Creative Web-Development</strong> is about apps and their features. And together they are a framework to express yourself through the means of modern multimedia technology.</p><p>I will share my experience, help you build your own knowledge and plan of action to develop sufficient skills to use it creatively. You are free to use all this for your self-expression!</p></div>',1)),s(g,{class:"mx-2",video:"34Sg5JMlE10"}),s(m),s(h(o)),e[1]||(e[1]=n('<div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">TIP</p><h3 id="prototyping-efficient-educational-models" tabindex="-1">Prototyping efficient educational models <a class="header-anchor" href="#prototyping-efficient-educational-models" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Prototyping efficient educational models&quot;">​</a></h3><p>While being fundamentally different, sensations converge in our brains so we can build any kinds of connections there. That&#39;s how anyone may once see sounds and music in color. That&#39;s how I studied music myself: with colorful stickers applied on the keyboard of my OP-1 and a memo cheatsheet with diagrams of all chords in basic diatonic scales to put at sight and go with all this to any rehearsal or jam place to start exploring this tonal space with other musicians.</p><p>And then I realized how valuable those unique moments of joy are when people play together in sync, and got immersed in live music more and more. While having published tracks and experience in many other fields, live jam performance is in my focus for many years and from many perspectives.</p><p>Around year 2017 it all started as web development excercise app just to calculate the frequency of note A 40th octave and compare it to light spectrum. After I saw red A and how octave fits with color circle, I never stopped developing this project further. It has grown into a web-site, a sticker shop, a video-course, a book in the making. Now Chromatone is quite a developed research with plenty of theory and practice materials ready to be shared with people from around the world.</p><p>Online tutorship and video courses are not really that effective as we are quite used to watch videos with no interaction with others. But interactions with other students inside and outside the classroom is integral part of study and growth. As an adult you want effective education for students of any level of prior knowledge and achievable knowledge and skills for all. And I want to explore this field more by starting to grow a creative multimedia school with 4 programs to provide valuable knowledge and skills to both local and global communities of music explorers.</p><p>Dynamic group education is an important part of study process as it provides opportunities to also ask questions and explain something to others so that you better understand the subject yourself.</p></div><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">TIP</p><h2 id="weekly-classes" tabindex="-1">Weekly classes <a class="header-anchor" href="#weekly-classes" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Weekly classes&quot;">​</a></h2><p>So, here&#39;s what we have now:</p><ul><li>1 month short courses</li><li>Weekly 1 hour group classes with creative homework</li><li>4-8 students per course</li></ul><h3 id="_1-hour-guided-group-education-sessions" tabindex="-1">1 hour guided group education sessions <a class="header-anchor" href="#_1-hour-guided-group-education-sessions" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;1 hour guided group education sessions&quot;">​</a></h3><h3 id="presentation-20-min" tabindex="-1">Presentation - 20 min <a class="header-anchor" href="#presentation-20-min" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Presentation - 20 min&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Tightly packed prepared comprehensive overview of a given topic with a slideshow and interactive examples.
