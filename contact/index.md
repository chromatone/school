# What is it?

Chromatone Creative Multimedia School @ Place Coworking, Phuket

## Chromatone

Visual Music Language developed by Denis Starov, that uses colors and shapes to communicate notes and rhythms and vice versa.

# Creative Multimedia

We embrace human creativity as the main source of happiness and prosperity for all. Be it live music, visuals, video streaming or any combinations of mediums. In modern world everyone can create content as a personal contribution to our global networking culture. What content and what way - you decide. We just have Programs as entry points for rather different aspects of Creative Multimedia.

# School

It's the closest term for now for an educational experiment, that implements leaded group study of arts. We teach music by visual means and it appears to be highly effective, especially for people, not understanding music at all. Chromatone system gives a color for each frequency so we can point at notes and overtones across keys, fretboards, prints, interactive web-apps, videos and other multimedia.

What we teach is transforming ideas into something other people can perceive and relate to.

Our classes consist of students of various levels of musical skill so each one more advanced gets an opportunity to teach complex things in an approachable way to those, who may be just starting.
